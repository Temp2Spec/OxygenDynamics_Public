OxySinkArea_um : the mean surface of each oxygen sink locus in microns (calculated based on pixel size input) for all mice/experimental groups. The mouse# can be seen next to each datapoint

OxySinkFilledArea_um: same as OxySinkArea_um but this is for filled area in case of suboptimal detection of oxygen concentraion sinks

OxySinkDiameter_um: the mean diameter of each oxygen sink locus in microns

OxySinkPerimeter_um: the mean perimeter of each oxygen sink event in microns

OxySinkArea_Norm: the mean surface of each oxygen sink event normalised to the area of paremchyma recorded for each mouse recording

OxySinkArea_Filled_Norm: same as OxySinkArea_Norm but this is for filled area in case of suboptimal detection of oxygen concentraion sinks

NumOxySinkEvents_Norm: the number of hypoxic events per minute each oxygen sink locus

MeanOxySinkEvent_Duration: the mean duration of hypoxic events for each oxygen sink locus in seconds

MeanOxySinkEvent_NormAmp: the mean amplitude of signal change of hypoxic events for each oxygen sink locus relative to the signal for 20sec before each event. 

MeanOxySinkEvent_SizeMod: the mean size modulation of hypoxic events for each oxygen sink locus. This (size of sink at the end-size of sink at the start)/size of sink at start. Concretelly, negative size modulation means the sink starts larger and shrinks with time.

SinksEvents X different experimental groups: each sheet contains the alligned signal traces (arbitrary units)for each oxygen concentration sink event (rows). The signal of each event has been normalized to be 0 at the start.

ROI Mean: traces with the mean signal value (arbitrary units) across all spatial bins covering the recording area for each mouse/experimental group.  

ROI CovCoef: traces with the covariance coefficient across signal from all spatial bins covering the recording area for each mouse/experimental group.  Higher values suggests more pronounced spatial organisation of oxygen concetration signal. Widespread signal patterns lead to decrease in covariance coefficient.

ROI Entropy: traces with the Shannon entropy of the signal across all spatial bins covering the recording area for each mouse/experimental group. Similar to covariance coefficient, higher values suggests more pronounced spatial organisation of oxygen concetration signal. Widespread signal patterns lead to decrease in covariance coefficient.

OxySinks HowMany: traces with the total number of ongoing oxygen concentration sinks at any given frame

OxySinksArea_Norm: traces with the total area part of oxygen conctration sinks at any given frame normalised to the area of paremchyma recorded for each mouse recording

ROIdiff Mean: traces with the mean first differential (change) of signal value (arbitrary units) across all spatial bins covering the recording area for each mouse/experimental group. This reflects the change in signal of recording area as a whole.

ROIdiff CovCoef: traces with the covariance coefficient across the signal differential (change) from all spatial bins covering the recording area for each mouse/experimental group. Higher values suggests more pronounced spatial organisation of oxygen concetration signal changes. Widespread signal pattern changes lead to decrease in covariance coefficient.

ROIdiff Entropy: traces with the Shannon entropy across the signal differential (change) from all spatial bins covering the recording area for each mouse/experimental group. Similar to covariance coefficient, higher values suggests more pronounced spatial organisation of oxygen concetration signal changes. Widespread signal pattern changes lead to decrease in covariance coefficient. 

OxySinksArea_um: traces with the total area part of oxygen conctration sinks at any given frame in microns

ROI Mean vs CovCoef: correlation of between the mean signal value trace and the covariance coefficient trace for each mouse. Higher values means that when we have an over surge in oxygen concentration the spatial distribution of the singal is more pronounced. On the other hand negative values suggest that signal surges lead to more spatial homogeneity and therefore less covariance coefficient. The order of mice for each experimental group is the same as in previous sheets (but vertical)

ROI Mean vs Entropy: homologous concept to ROI Mean vs CovCoef

CovCoef vs Entropy: control analysis to see how well the two expressions of spatial homogeneity correlate. 

ROIdiff Mean vs diffCovCoef: correlation of mean signal differential (change) and covariance coefficient differential. Higher correlation suggests that the change of signal towards oxygen surges and sinks coincides with increase and decrease in spatial homogenetity of the same signal.

ROIdiff Mean vs diffEntropy: homologous concept to ROIdiff Mean vs diffCovCoef

diffCovCoef vs diffEntropy: control analysis to see how well the two expressions of changes in spatial homogeneity correlate. 

OxySinksArea vs CovCoef: correlation between the total area belonging to oxygen concentration sink loci and the spatial heterogeneity. Higher values suggests that when the oxygen sink area is smaller and larger, the spatial heterogeneity is increasing and decreasing accordingly.
